# Notifications

Traduttore has built-in support for the unofficial [Slack WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/slack/).

Using this plugin you can set up notifications to be sent to your Slack workspace whenever translations are updated or language packs are built.

## Setting up Slack notifications

You can download and install the [Slack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/slack/) from WordPress.org.

After you activate the plugin, head over to the new Slack top level menu item in the admin bar and create new notifications.

Traduttore adds two types of notifications:

* When a new translation ZIP file is built
* When new translations are updated for a project

### Example

You can see an example screenshot of these notifications in the [introductory blog post](https://required.com/en/translation-workflow-glotpress-traduttore/).
